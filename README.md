# Marathon-Timings-ML-model
I built a machine learning model in python using a public marathon dataset of the Prague 2017 marathon from kaggle to predict an athletes marathon timings based on certain features. I am currently in the process of building a react application using node js to authorize a user's strava account, pull data (features) and predict the user's marathon timing.
# Build Status:
The project is under completion. A machine learning model is constructed, however, can be improved.
# Tech/Framework used:
Python
Pandas
